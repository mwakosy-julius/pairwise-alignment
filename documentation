🧬 About this web app
Global and local alignment between two DNA strings (pairwise alignment).

⚙️ How it works
Global alignment is an end-to-end alignment based on Needleman-Wunsch algorithm, which searches for the optimal global alignment (highest score) between two sequences.
Local alignment identify regions of similarity between two sequences based on Smith-Waterman algorithm, which searches for the optimal alignment (highest score) between two subsequences.

🔢 Scoring
The scores for match and mismatch were based on nucleotide substitution model K2P (Kimura 2-parameters) which allows for different rates of transition and transversion.
> Match = +4, for similarity
> Mismatch = -1, for transition
> Mismatch = -2, for transversion
> Gap = -3, for insertion or deletion

📊 Nucleotides content
This web app also counts the amount and percentage of Adenin, Cytosin, Guanin and Thymin and GC-Content from each sequence.
